/**
 * This class calculates the method hiding factor metric. If the method hiding
 * factor calculation is 100% then it implies that all methods are private,
 * indicating either a god class or an application with very little
 * functionality. A very high MHF implies that very few methods can be reused
 * with a view to over-riding and refining. A low MHF indicates an insufficient
 * level of abstraction in a design, a large proportion of unprotected methods
 * and a high probability of error. Increasing MHF has been shown to decrease
 * defects and increase overall quality. While the optimal MHF threshold range
 * depends on the nature of the problem domain, a range of 8-25% MHF has been
 * suggested as reasonable.
